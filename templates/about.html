  Cory in the House is an American television series which aired on the Disney
  Channel from January 12, 2007, to September 12, 2008, and was a spin-off from
  the Disney show That's So Raven. The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves
  from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after
  Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The
  series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off.
  This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in
  standard definition for the entire length of the show. Reruns of the series
  have not been aired on Disney Channel, or on Disney XD; however, they continue
  to air on the Family channel in Canada. Raven-Symon√© guest-starred, reprising
  her role as Raven Baxter in only one episode. In 2014, Disney Channel started
  airing a weekly block called Disney Replay on Wednesdays nights, during which
  episodes of Cory in the House air alongside That's So Raven and Kim Possible,
  among others.
